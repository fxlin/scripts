used for emulating bursty workloads


build and run for panda OK.


TO BUILD:
1. plug in usb cable to device
./build.sh


TO RUN:
1. plug in usb cable to device

adb shell

~ # cd /data/local/ && ./nohup ./bursty&
nohup: appending output to nohup.out


2. verify it runs

~ # ps |grep bursty
 1530 root       640 S    ./bursty
  1600 root      1820 S    grep bursty


3. unplug usb cable (with the power cord plugged, otherwise panda loses power)

4. plug usb cable back, repeat step 2, to see verify bursty is still alive 

Measurement should be taken between step 3 and 4.



TODO: before busy(), toggle some GPIO line so that the starting point of the workloads can be observed by external oscilloscope.
